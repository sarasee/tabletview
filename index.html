    <img class="head" src="images/mochi.png" style="width:400px;" alt="Brown Smiley Dog"/>
        <p>Mochi is my sister's dog, and we got her a little over two years ago. She is a true quarantine dog and therefore is scared of everyone— especially men. She hates my dad the most, and ironically loves my mom the most.
            Currently Mochi is living in Arkansas, as my sister has gone to med school there. She enjoys the long winding pathways and nice greenery, which are very different from Baltimore which is where she used to live!</p>

            <img style="width:400px;" src="images/honey_main.jpeg" alt="Honey is a medium-sized golden retriever with honey brown fur. She has a white patch of fur on her chest and her right eye is smaller than her left">
            <p>Honeys favorite thing in the world is swimming. Even if it is the middle of January and half of the lake is frozen, Honey will be in the water. She is a smart swimmer, so when my brother and I go underwater, she will follow our air bubbles and be waiting for us when we come up for air.</p>
            <p>While most dogs like to chase balls or sticks, Honey likes to chase rocks. She will even chase rocks into the water and stick her whole face in the water to try and find the rock thrown. Chasing rocks is her main form of exercise right now as she refuses to go on walks from our house. If we drive her to another spot and walk from there, Honey will go on a walk but she refuses to leave our driveway when we try to walk from home. Finally one other Honey-ism is that her safe place is bathtubs. Many times our family has woken up in the middle of the night and found Honey is a bathtub</p>

            <p>MiaoMiao is the best cat in the world, extremely social with other, and vigilant against strangers. Oftentimes you can find her running around the house looking for things to eat. If she consumed anything other than cat food, she immediately throws up. </p>
            <p>She is chill and chirpy. Loves to play with anything other than professional cat toys. Also loves sitting on keyboards and joining Zoom calls.</p>

                <img src="images/hazel.jpg" alt="Yellow Labrador retriever standing in front of a glass door." style="width:400px;">
    
                <p>Hazel is a year-old yellow Labrador retriever that enjoys long walks 
                    and playing catch (in or out of the water). She has a lot of energy, 
                    so she gets restless if she does not have enough exercise. Hazel loves 
                    meeting new people and seeing old friends. She likes to jump on people, 
                    but she is friendly and does not mean any harm.</p>
    
                <p>Hazel will eat anything and everything. Like most Labrador retrievers, 
                    she loves food and will eat things that are not actually edible. Some 
                    of the things that Hazel has chewed on include hand towels, blankets, 
                    Apple Airpods, and Halloween decorations. She also loves to eat human 
                    food such as lettuce.</p>

            <p>Bear is a lazy, food-loving dog that is sometimes playful. His favorite activity is lying in the sun on his side and lounging. He enjoys playing with his toys and loves to fetch them when you throw them, but eventually, he gets bored and just stops fetching them and lays down.</p>
            <p>Bear is also scared of a lot of things. He doesn’t like water (showers and even rain) or getting his nails clipped, and he’s sometimes even so lazy that he’ll just stop walking and sit down until you turn around and go back home. </p>

            <p>
                Jax is a kitten, about five months old that I found this summer at a gas station while traveling to Marquette, Michigan. He was scared and malnourished, crying in the parking lot. I took him with me and after some healthy meals and a trip to the vet he is doing great!
            </p>
            <p>
                My roommates and I just recently moved and Jax has been having a hard time getting used to the large house since we were previously living in a small apartment. Jax is incredibly playful and loves to run around, but when he is sleepy he is happy to be held.

            <img width="400" src="images/cheeto_cattree.jpg" alt="Orange cat hanging paws off a cat tower">
            <p>
                Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get outside every single day. If he isn’t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.
