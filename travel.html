            <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
            <p>The Grand Canyon is a natural geological formation located in the state of Arizona. It is a steep-sided canyon carved by the Colorado River over millions of years. The canyon is known for its size, vibrant and varied colors, and intricate rock formations. It is one of the most famous and visited natural landmarks in the United States and around the world.</p>
            <p>
                Though the Grand Canyon is one of the most iconic places to travel, there are many dangers that come from such a terrain. Between 2010 and 2020, 134 have died, mainly due to extreme heat. You can see below, examples of people getting hurt due to the heat and carelessness.

As a northern people from China, Nanjing was the first city that I traveled to the region south of the Yangtze River. Confucius Temple - Qinhuai River is the most famous place to show the beauty of Nanjing.</p>
        
        <p>Confucius temple has many traditional temple agricultures inside and many small shops about traditional Nanjing specialties and popular restaurants. There are also many colorful traditional lanterns which made the night of qinhuai more gorgeous.
